In this data Science Project, We have crawled a dataset based on hotels/resorts in Finland from a popular tourism website, TripAdvisor.com. Since the project was of academic nature, we tried different machine learning models to evaluate sentiments expressed in reviews and compared our results against the ratings given by users to get an idea about how good our models are. We also grouped hotels based on what people talk about in their reviews and got some interesting results.

Silhouette coefficient was utilised to evaluated hotels clusters. TF-IDF was used in the text vectorisation of the reviews.  Every review had a score raking as well as a review title. The review title was therefore used in imputing missing reviews in the data. K-means apparently provided better results although various clustering techniques were employed in the analysis of the data.  In addition to the selection of the clustering technique, a reasonable clustering factor (k) was calculated using various k factors and comparing results.

We used people reviews, review titles and hotels tags to train clustering model. Using clustering model we cluster different hotels. Our results depict bag of important words, recommend user to identify that what kind of activities can be done and what are the good hotels/resorts to stay while traveling.

To see results and detailed descritpion. See our blog post.
